  |   It's time to make your prisoner truly yours. Choose from a massive    |
  |   array of customisations to make your character unique to you. It's    |
  |   important to look stylish whilst you mastermind your escape.          |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Being in prison forces you to be creative and work with the limited   |
  |   tools at your disposal. You'll have to combine everyday objects       |
  |   like soap and socks to craft new weapons and tools to help you        |
  |   achieve your goal. Steal forks from the cafeteria to chip a tunnel    |
  |   in your room, and craft a poster from magazines and duct tape to      |
  |   hide the evidence. You'll soon learn that duct tape solves (almost)   |
  |   everything!                                                           |

  |   Prepare for a fight!                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Escapists 2 introduces a brand new combat system to make every    |
  |   prison brawl more exciting and interactive. You'll have to block      |
  |   and tie together chains of attacks whilst strafing around your        |
  |   locked on targets to gain the upper hand in combat. Make sure your    |
  |   visit the gym first to build up those muscles!                        |
  |                                                                         |
